        "description": "About Gasser True Value Gasser Hardware originally opened in 1902 with John Gasser, in the community of Blue River, WI. Ray Gasser, Johns younger brother, opened a store in Boscobel in 1923. The second generation of the family, Bob Schmidt Sr. and Virginia Gasser Schmidt took over the stores operation in 1946. Bob Sr. and a third generation Bob Jr. and Jan Folbrecht Schmidt bought out Schwartz Ace Hardware in downtown Lancaster in 1971. Bob Jr. and Jan ran the store until 1975, when they built a new 20,000 sq. ft. store on Hwy 61N in Lancaster. They bought out Bob Sr. in 1978 and in 1979 built a new 30,000 sq. ft. store in Boscobel. The fourth generation, Rob III and Dan helped continue the family tradition. Bob, Jan, and Rob opened a store in January 1997 in Hazel Green; two years later in October 1999, Dan joined the trio in the Galena and Maquoketa acquisitions. Gasser True Value Hardware and Farm Supply locales offer the primary source of plumbing, electrical, power tools and hardware in each town they are located. The company expanded its merchandise line in 1975 to include farm supplies fencing, animal health, convenience feeds and farm implement repair parts. Each company locale is also the primary source of farm and fencing supplies for their town. In the late 1970s the company expanded into lawn and garden including live plants and shrubs. August 1995, the decision was made to enter into the rental market with Just Ask RentalΝ, a store within a store. Offerings include tents, tables, chairs, heaters, fans, post hole diggers, to name a few. Rentals are available at every location except Hazel Green, where a grocery store (7,000 out of the 18,000 square foot) shares space with hardware. Hazel Green store customers have the opportunity to rent items from other Gasser outlets, if they so choose. In 1982, Gasser was the first hardware store in Wisconsin computerized to track inventory at point of sale. Today, all five stores are electronically linked. Nearly four generations later, Gasser True Value Hardware and Farm supply boasts five stores: Boscobel, Lancaster and Hazel Green in Wisconsin; Galena, Illinois; and Maquoketa, Iowa."

        "description": "The Boscobel Hotel is on the State & National Registers of Historic Places; built in 1863. At almost any hotel in the world you will find a Gideon Bible provided by Gideons International. The birthplace of the Gideons was the Central House Hotel on September 14, 1898. Traveling salesmen John H. Nicholson of Janesville, Wisconsin, and Samuel E. Hill of Beloit, Wisconsin, shared a room in the crowded hotel because of a lumbermans convention. In Room 19, the men discovered that they were both Christians; they talked about starting a Christian traveling mens association. The following May the two salesmen, joined by a third, William J. Knights, rekindled that idea, and on July 1, 1899, founded the Gideons. The name Gideon comes from the Old Testament Book of Judges, and refers to a man who was willing to do whatever God asked of him. Today, the Boscobel Hotel, where the two founders met, is listed on the National Historical Register, and Room 19, where the idea of the Gideons was conceived, is preserved and marked with a special plaque."

We design, manufacture and distribute signs of all types throughout the entire country. At American Signs & Designs there is no sign that is too large or too small for us to produce. We have become well known for our distribution of what we call LED TV Signs. LED TV is our unique and original approach to LED Sign content or programming. We believe that if you own a LED Sign that can only display text, then you only own half a sign. Even our smallest outdoor LED display comes with a complete animation library absolutely free, unlike any other company anywhere. In addition to being a leader in LED Moving Message Signs, American Signs & Designs fabricates custom awnings, builds both illuminated and non illuminated signs, and digital prints everything from bumper stickers to billboards."

        "description": "Since the construction of the old depot in 1857, the Boscobel Depot was the heartbeat of the area. It served as the marshaling point of 2,000 plus young enlisted men of the Union Army and again in subsequent years of W.W.I and W.W.II. It also served the area with food and industrial goods, as well as travel-through station. Included among notable people entering the City were the two traveling salesmen, Samuel E. Hill and John H. Nicholson, who began the writings of the Gideon Bible, as well as John Blaine who left the City for a 3-term governorship of Wisconsin and later adversary for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Boscobel Depot has recently been restored and will again serve the community as a very functional building with the conversion of its interior into a Turn-of-the-Century Railroad and Early Rural American Walk-through Museum. The Boscobel Chamber of Commerce and Boscobel Community Foundation offices are located in the Depot building. For more information call 608-375-2672."

        "description": "Shadewald Mound Group (sometimes called Elder Group) is an incredibly well preserved group of Native American effigy mounds. Thanks to Frank Shadewald, who purchased the land with the sole purpose of preserving the mounds, there is no other group of mounds that could compare with Shadewald as far as the state of preservation goes. There are two clusters of mounds out there. One is located on top of Frank’s Hill and consists of, among others, a raptor and a bison effigies. The other cluster is on top of the hill just across the road from Frank’s Hill (below). It consists of 12 conical mounds in almost perfect linear formation within the same distance of one another. It is thought that the mounds have some calendar meaning. Although its unlikely the Native American and Roman (with 12 months) calendars had anything in common, events like lunar cycles and solstice are the same all around the world – and that’s where that string of mounds comes in. Both groupings are located on both sides of HWY193 just north of the intersection with HWY60 west of Muscoda."
